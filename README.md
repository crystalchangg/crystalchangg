### Hi :)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m Crystal, and I'm an applied statistics major, planning to minor in bioinformatics and public health at UC Davis. I am new at coding, but I enjoy learning languages like python and R, which can be applied to biology. You can check out some of my mini coding chunks here, as well as my linkedin at [https://www.linkedin.com/in/crystal-changg/](url).
